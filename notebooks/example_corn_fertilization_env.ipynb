    "Here, we present an example of how to use the basic corn fertilization environment to simulate an expert fertilizaiton policy based on the [recommendations by the Pennsylvania state university](https://extension.psu.edu/nitrogen-fertilization-of-corn). The simulation will be for the years 1980 and 1981 with fixed weather from Rock Springs, PA."
