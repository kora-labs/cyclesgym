## Default operations

In cyclesgym environments, we usually keep some management aspects fixed and 
optimize only a subset of them. For example, in the fertilization environments,
tillage and planting are pre-determined and RL agents cannot affect them. 
Here, we explain how to specify and modify these default operations.

During initialization, the environments take a keyword argument that is 
`opearation_file`. This argument specifies the name of the operation file 
that contains the default operation that will be executed in the 
environments. A few things are important to notice about this file:
 1. It should be in a Cycles-compatible format (see [here](https://psumodeling.github.io/Cycles/#management-operations-file-operation)).
 2. It should be contained in the Cycles input folder, i.e., `cycles/input`.
 3. If it contains operations that belong to the decision space, those will 
    be removed. We will clarify this with an example below.

An example of a file containing tillage, planting, and fertilization 
operations could be the following. Let us assume that this file is stored 
in `cycles/input/corn_operation.operation`  (for an example of how to 
modify this kind of files directly in Python with cyclesgym's managers, see 
[here](../notebooks/example_corn_fertilization_env.ipynb)).

Then, we can initialize a fertilization environment as follows

```
from cyclesgym.envs import Corn

env = Corn(delta=7,         # Time interval is one week
           n_actions=11,    # There are 11 actions available
           maxN=150,        # Actions are spaced uniformly in [0, 150]
           operation_file='corn_operation.operation')
```

When running this environment, planting and tillage will be performed as 
specified by the original file. However, fertilization will be modified. In 
particular, since this is a N fertilization environment where RL agents 
must make decisions concerning N fertilization, the masses of NH4 and NO3 
will be set to zero at the beginning of the simulation (and eventually 
modified further as the episode unrolls and the agent makes decisions). The 
carbon fertilization is not modified as this is not part of the decision 
space of this environment.
