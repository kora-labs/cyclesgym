## Custom states, actions, and rewards
To specify custom states, actions, and rewards, it is necessary to specify the corresponding 
observer, implementer, and rewarder (see [cyclesgym's logic](3_logic.md)). It is possible to do so by 
creating completely new ones from scratch or combining existing ones (this is not yet possible for actions).
We explain how to do this with an example in [this notebook](../notebooks/build_custom_environment.ipynb).
